\title{Logistic map}
\usage{
logisticMap(
  r = 4,
  start = runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 1),
  n.sample = 5000,
  n.transient = 500,
  do.plot = deprecated()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{The \emph{r} parameter. Default: 4}

\item{start}{A numeric value indicating the starting value for the time 
series. If the starting point is not specified, it is generated randomly.}

\item{n.sample}{Length of the generated time series. Default: 5000 samples.}

\item{n.transient}{Number of transient samples that will be discarded. 
Default: 500 samples.}

\item{do.plot}{Logical value. If TRUE, a plot of the 
generated logistic system is shown. Before version 0.2.11, default value was
TRUE; versions 0.2.11 and later use FALSE as default.}
}
\value{
A vector containing the values of the time series that has been 
generated.
}
\description{
Generates a time series using the logistic map.
}
\details{
The logistic map is defined as follows:
\deqn{x_n = r  \cdot  x_{n-1}   \cdot  (1 - x_{n-1})}{x[n] = r * x[n-1]  * (1 - x[n-1])}
The default selection for the \emph{r} parameter is known to
produce a deterministic chaotic time series.
}
\note{
Some initial values may lead to an unstable system that will tend to 
infinity.
