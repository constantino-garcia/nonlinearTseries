\description{
Time Reversibility statistic
}
\details{
The time simmetry statistic  measures the asymmetry of a time series 
under time reversal by calculating:
\deqn{E[s_n\cdot s_{n+1}^2] - E[s_n^2\cdot s_{n+1}] }{E[s_n * s_{n+1}^2] - E[s_n^2 * s_{n+1}] }.
Since linear stochastic series are symmetric under time reversal, this 
statistic may be used for testing the assertion that the data was generated
from a stationary linear stochastic process or not.
